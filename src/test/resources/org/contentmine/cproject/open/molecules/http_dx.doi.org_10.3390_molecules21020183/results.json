      "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a prime reason for numerous failed oncotherapy approaches. In the present study, we investigated whether Alisol F 24 acetate (ALI) could reverse the MDR of MCF-7/DOX cells, a multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cell line. We found that ALI was a potent P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, in the Caco-2-monolayer cell model. ALI showed a significant and concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect on MCF-7/DOX cells in combination with doxorubicin by increasing intracellular accumulation and inducing nuclear migration of doxorubicin. However, ALI had no such effect on MCF-7 cells. In addition, ALI also promoted doxorubicin-induced early apoptosis of MCF-7/DOX cells in a time-dependent manner. These results suggest that ALI can enhance chemosensitivity of doxorubicin and reinforce its anti-cancer effect by increasing its uptake, especially inducing its nuclear accumulation in MCF-7/DOX cells. Therefore, ALI could be developed as a potential MDR-reversing agent in cancer chemotherapy in further study."
