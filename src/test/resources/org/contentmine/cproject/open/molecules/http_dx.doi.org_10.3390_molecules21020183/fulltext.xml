      <abstract>
        <p>Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a prime reason for numerous failed oncotherapy approaches. In the present study, we investigated whether Alisol F 24 acetate (ALI) could reverse the MDR of MCF-7/DOX cells, a multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cell line. We found that ALI was a potent P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, in the Caco-2-monolayer cell model. ALI showed a significant and concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect on MCF-7/DOX cells in combination with doxorubicin by increasing intracellular accumulation and inducing nuclear migration of doxorubicin. However, ALI had no such effect on MCF-7 cells. In addition, ALI also promoted doxorubicin-induced early apoptosis of MCF-7/DOX cells in a time-dependent manner. These results suggest that ALI can enhance chemosensitivity of doxorubicin and reinforce its anti-cancer effect by increasing its uptake, especially inducing its nuclear accumulation in MCF-7/DOX cells. Therefore, ALI could be developed as a potential MDR-reversing agent in cancer chemotherapy in further study.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Currently, one challenge faced by cancer chemotherapy is the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-molecules-21-00183">1</xref>]. After a long-term exposure to anticancer drugs in malignant tumor cells, MDR cells acquire resistance to one chemotherapeutic drug, and and may also become resistant to some other anticancer drugs featuring different structures and functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-molecules-21-00183">2</xref>]. A wide range of structurally diverse drugs used to treat cancer are extruded from cells, including doxorubicin, vinblastine, epipodophyllotoxins and paclitaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-molecules-21-00183">3</xref>]. Efflux proteins that mediate MDR of cancer cells are mainly the superfamily of adenosine triphosphate binding cassette-(ABC) transporters, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-molecules-21-00183">4</xref>], multi-drug resistance protein (MRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-molecules-21-00183">5</xref>] and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-molecules-21-00183">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-molecules-21-00183">7</xref>]. The overexpression of P-gp is considered to be a classic mechanism of MDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-molecules-21-00183">8</xref>]. Encoded by ABCB1 gene, P-gp is a transmembrane protein and works as an ATP-dependent drug transporter. P-gp increases efflux of anticancer drugs, reducing intracellular drug levels and causing consequent drug insensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-molecules-21-00183">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-molecules-21-00183">10</xref>]. Apart from the development of multidrug resistance, severe side effects also stand in the way of cancer chemotherapy. The calcium channel blocker verapamil and the immune suppressor cyclosporin A have been proposed as modulators of P-gp to be used in association with anticancer drugs substrates of this efflux pump. However, serious cardiovascular adverse reactions, immune suppression and kidney toxicity have emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-molecules-21-00183">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-molecules-21-00183">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>In our paper, a new P-gp inhibitor was combined with doxorubicin in an effort to reverse MDR. Natural products serve as a reliable and excellent source for pharmaceutical development in recent years. According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, it is convincingly demonstrated that nearly 69% of all anticancer drugs approved from the 1980s to 2002 are either natural products or derivatives synthesized based on the information provided by natural products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-molecules-21-00183">13</xref>]. A variety of natural product-derived drugs have been demonstrated to show reversal effects on MDR cells, including moollugin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-molecules-21-00183">14</xref>], guggulsterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-molecules-21-00183">15</xref>] and rabdosia rubescens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-molecules-21-00183">16</xref>]. They enhance chemosensitivity of MDR-cells by increasing cellular influx of anticancer drugs. Meanwhile they are less toxic than chemically synthesized substances. Paclitaxel, a natural product from the bark of the Pacific yew <italic>Taxus brevifolia</italic>, reveals curative effects on human breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-molecules-21-00183">17</xref>]. Therefore, natural products from traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) hold a great promise for discovering safer and more efficacious MDR-reversal agents.</p>
      <p>In China, <italic>Rhizoma alismatis</italic> is used to clear damp and heat as well as to promote diuresis. In recent years, <italic>Rhizoma alismatis</italic> has achieved initial success in exerting obvious effects on diuretic, anti-inflammatory hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and antihypertensive therapies, inhibiting formation of kidney stones and regulating immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-molecules-21-00183">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Alisol F 24 acetate (ALI) is a triterpene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-21-00183-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) extracted from the dry tubers of <italic>Rhizoma alismatis</italic>. Polycyclic triterpene compounds have been demonstrated to be P-gp inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-molecules-21-00183">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-molecules-21-00183">20</xref>]. Meanwhile, the structure of ALI is similar to that of alisol B 23-acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-21-00183-f001">Figure 1</xref>b), which has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-molecules-21-00183">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-molecules-21-00183">22</xref>]. There is a possibility that ALI is a P-gp inhibitor with a pentacyclic structure. Herein we explore its ability to reverse P-gp-mediated MDR.</p>

      <p>As Caco-2 cell monolayers overexpress P-gp after cultivation, they are often introduced as a model to screen P-gp inhibitors. In the article, this model was designed to investigate whether ALI was a P-gp inhibitor and, if so, a series of cell-based experiments were conducted using High Content Analysis (HCA). Doxorubicin is a potent antibiotic commonly used in human breast cancer chemotherapy. Doxorubicin has been chosen both as an anticancer drug and a P-gp fluorescence substrate. The direct inhibition of P-gp by ALI and its underlying mechanism were explored by studying the intracellular accumulation and nucleus distribution of doxorubicin in the presence of ALI. We also investigated the pharmacological function (early apoptosis) of doxorubicin to further confirm above results. Our research helped to elucidate the synergic effects of ALI with some anticancer drugs, as a part of identifying efficient and safe P-gp modulators from Traditional Chinese medicine. It is a promising contemporary strategy to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents, especially anticancer drugs, with adjunctive therapy or alternative medication.</p>

        <p>Similar to its effect on intracellular accumulation, ALI significantly increased nuclear migration of doxorubicin in MCF-7/DOX cells in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-21-00183-f007">Figure 7</xref>A) while had no effect on MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-21-00183-f007">Figure 7</xref>B).</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-21-00183-f007">Figure 7</xref>C, doxorubicin (labeled by red fluorescence) was distributed in the cytoplasm without gathering in the nuclei (labeled in blue by Hoechst33342) in untreated MCF-7/DOX cells. Addition of 5, 10, and 20 &#x3BC;M ALI or 10 &#x3BC;M verapamil not only increased doxorubicin intensity but also its migration into the nucleus (reflected in a color shift from blue to purple in nuclei, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-21-00183-f007">Figure 7</xref>C: a&#x2013;e). In contrast, doxorubicin is mainly distributed in the nuclei (indicated by red and blue fluorescence overlay) in untreated MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-21-00183-f007">Figure 7</xref>C: f&#x2013;j). All these results suggest that ALI not only increase intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin but also induce its migration into nuclei in MCF-7/DOX cells, but not MCF-7 cells.</p>
        <p>According to semi-quantitative fluorescence assessment, the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in MCF-7 cells is 4.7 times the amount of that in MCF-7/DOX cells. As the concentration of ALI increases, the fluorescence intensity of doxorubicin in the nuclei gradually intensifies. Similarly, neither ALI nor verapamil have this effect on MCF-7 cells.</p>
        <p>In data analysis, we select the ratio of fluorescence intensity in nucleus to fluorescence intensity in cytoplasmic (n/c ratio) to illustrate how ALI affected doxorubicin targeted distribution in cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-21-00183-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the n/c ratio in sensitive cells is nearly 3.5 times of that in MDR-cells. The n/c ratio is thus a more sensitive indicator for MDR phenomenon in MCF-7/DOX cells than intracellular accumulation and nuclear redistribution of doxorubicin in the nuclei.</p>

      <title>3. Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, ALI serves as a potent MDR-reversal inhibitor overcoming the multidrug resistance in MCF-7/DOX cells. Human breast cancer chemotherapy faces serious challenges in reversing MDR. Inhibition of the expression of P-gp will enhance chemosensitivity of MDR-cells. It has been reported that P-gp has several physiological effects including protection against toxic xenobiotics by excreting them into bile and urine, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-molecules-21-00183">23</xref>], and the transport of steroid hormones and cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-molecules-21-00183">24</xref>]. Many reversal agents from traditional Chinese medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-molecules-21-00183">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26-molecules-21-00183">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27-molecules-21-00183">27</xref>] have been investigated based on their inhibitory activity of ABC transporters. However, the potential of ALI reversing P-gp mediated MDR was demonstrated for the first time in this experiment.</p>
      <p>In 2004, Fong <italic>et al.</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-molecules-21-00183">21</xref>] reported that alisol B 23 acetate could be a P-gp substrate. Additionally, alisol B 23 acetate was also a partial non-competitive inhibitor of P-gp. Their results suggested that alisol B 23 acetate might be a potent MDR reversal agent. Continued progress was made in 2007 by the same group that showed extract of the rhizomes of <italic>Rhizoma Alismatis</italic> had a synergistic growth inhibitory effect with cancer drugs that are P-gp substrates, including actinomycin D, puromycin, paclitaxel, vinblastine and doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-molecules-21-00183">22</xref>]. However, the compound(s) that substantially contributed to the reversal effects were not revealed. Using an ADME/Tox software (Percepta, ACD), we predicted P-gp inhibition of alisol B 23 acetate and alisol F 24 acetate. The P-gp inhibitor probability of alisol F 24 acetate is stronger than that of alisol B 23 acetate. Given that prediction result, we put forward a supposition that alisol F 24 acetate may serve as a potent inhibitor suppressing P-gp activity in the extract of <italic>Rhizoma Alismatis</italic>. We have carried out the subsequent study to demonstrate that ALI is a P-gp inhibitor.</p>
      <p>Caco-2 cell monolayers, originated from a human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line, overexpressed P-gp in the apical side after cultivation on polyester transwell plates for 21 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-molecules-21-00183">28</xref>]. Therefore, it can be used as a model to screen P-gp inhibitors. To verify the hypothesis that ALI was a P-gp inhibitor, we established Caco-2 cell monolayers according to the requirements of the FDA guidelines. Dense polarized monolayer cells start to emerge after Caco-2 cells are seeded on a permeable polyester insert in 12 well culture plates for 21-day growth. At that time, P-gp is highly expressed in absorptive direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-molecules-21-00183">29</xref>]. It would be easier for digoxin to transport from basolateral side to apical side. Polarity transport takes shape, which is presented in efflux ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30-molecules-21-00183">30</xref>]. Addition of P-gp inhibitor weakens polarized barrier by narrowing the difference between apical and basolateral sides. As the two-way transport experiment provides a real simulation for drugs penetrating through membranes, Caco-2 cell monolayers are the golden model to evaluate the bonds between P-gp substrate and P-gp inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31-molecules-21-00183">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32-molecules-21-00183">32</xref>]. Based on this model, digoxin with a high efflux ratio (ER = 17.2) was selected as a P-gp substrate indicating the Caco-2 monolayer model are reliable. Then the efflux ratio drops to 2.27 in the presence of ALI. What we have done succeeds in proving the former hypothesis that ALI serves as a potential P-gp inhibitor.</p>
      <p>We need to further assess the inhibition level of ALI through MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/DOX cells. Verapamil was taken as the positive drug. It has once been used as a P-gp reversal agent, but unfortunately severely side effects have made it limited access to clinical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-molecules-21-00183">11</xref>]. Doxorubicin is a chemotherapeutic drug for treatment of various kinds of tumors including breast cancer. Its target is the cell nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33-molecules-21-00183">33</xref>]. Non-toxic concentrations of ALI combined with some other anti-tumor drugs give a strong boost to the efficacy. In Caco-2 monolayer model, we have confirmed that ALI is a P-gp inhibitor. Then we study whether non-toxic concentrations of ALI enhance chemosensitivity of doxorubicin. We firstly investigate the efficacy of ALI in combination with doxorubicin in human breast MCF-7/DOX cells in an attempt to understand the reversal activity. IC<sub>50</sub> value of doxorubicin apparently decreased in MCF-7/DOX cells when combined with ALI (5, 10 or 20 &#x3BC;M). The decrease of IC<sub>50</sub> value confirms that ALI has the ability to reverse drug resistance and enhance chemosensitivity of doxorubicin in MCF-7/DOX cells. Meanwhile, the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in sensitive cells and MDR-cells will show a big difference. ALI can achieve success in reducing this difference. Then we design accumulation experiment in MCF-7/DOX cells and MCF-7 cells by HCA. Our data shows that the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in MCF-7 cells was 4.7 times the amount of that in MCF-7/DOX cells. Add of ALI increases intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in MCF-7/DOX cells while it has no effect on MCF-7 cells. All this analysis has testified our previous hypothesis. It is the decreasing accumulation that causes drug resistance. As a result, ALI enhances the chemosensitivity of MCF-7/DOX cells.</p>
      <p>As the target of doxorubicin is located in nucleus, the distribution of doxorubicin in cell will influence its efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34-molecules-21-00183">34</xref>]. The results of HCA demonstrated that doxorubicin mainly distributed in the nuclei in MCF-7 cells while majorly distributed in the cytoplasm in MCF-7/DOX cells. In the presence of ALI, the doxorubicin remarkably migrated from cytoplasm into nuclei in the MCF-7/DOX cells while no effect was seen in the sensitive cells. Meanwhile, the assays of the fluorescence intensity of doxorubicin in the nuclei and nucleus-cytoplasmic ratio also suggest the fact. The results further reveal that the resistance of MCF-7/DOX cells was deeply related to intracellular targeting distribution. ALI overcomes MDR by inducing the targeting distribution of doxorubicin in nuclei in MCF-7/DOX cells.</p>
      <p>Doxorubicin plays the role in anticancer process by embedding DNA bases and inhibiting the synthesis of nucleic acids and the target of nuclear distribution is directly related to its efficacy. We examined the influence of ALI on doxorubicin-induced early apoptosis of MCF-7/DOX cells. Cell apoptosis was one of the important efficacy evaluation indexes of antitumor drugs. The phenomenon was first discovered by Kerr in 1972 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35-molecules-21-00183">35</xref>]. The destruction of the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential that occurred before nucleus apoptosis (chromatin condensation and DNA fraction) is considered to be one of the earliest events in the cascade reaction of cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36-molecules-21-00183">36</xref>]. Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), a membrane-permeable cationic fluorescent dye, can migrate into the mitochondrial matrix driven by the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In normal cells, the fluorescence intensity becomes weaken or disappears. While cell apoptosis causes damage to the integrity of mitochondrial membrane and the collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, TMRE released the mitochondria emitting a strong orange fluorescence. Results showed that ALI dramatically promoted the doxorubicin-induced early apoptosis of MCF-7/DOX cells in a time-dependent manner.</p>
      <p>In general, the reversal of P-gp can be achieved either by inhibiting the efflux function of P-gp or ATPase activity or regulating P-gp expression. Based on the above results, further experiments were needed to examine the effect of ALI on P-gp expression (either the transcriptional or protein level). Meanwhile, which compound really works and which one is more potent in the extract of Rhizoma Alismatis are still a hard and long way ahead of us.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, ALI remarkably decreased the transport of digoxin in the BL-AP direction but increased that in the AP-BL direction, and decreased efflux ratio of digoxin. Our results clearly demonstrated that ALI is a powerful P-gp inhibitor. ALI reverses P-gp-mediated MDR and enhances chemosensitivity of doxorubicin by dose-dependently increasing its intracellular doxorubicin uptake and inducing nuclear localization in MCF-7/DOX cells. Moreover, ALI promoted doxorubicin-induced early apoptosis of MCF-7/DOX cells in a time-dependent manner implying that ALI synergistically enhanced antitumor effect of doxorubicin. Our study suggests that ALI may serve as a promising MDR reversal agent and a potential adjuvant for clinical cancer therapy in combination with antitumor drugs such as doxorubicin.</p>

        <p>The MCF-7/DOX cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, and the experiment was determined by the CCK-8 kit. After 24 h incubation, the wells were divided into two groups. One group was treated with various concentrations of doxorubicin alone while the other was treated with various concentrations of doxorubicin combined with ALI (5 &#x3BC;M, 10 &#x3BC;M, and 20 &#x3BC;M) for 24 h at 37 &#xB0;C. The medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing 10% CCK-8 solution and the plates were incubated for a further 3 h at 37 &#xB0;C in dark. The absorbance of each well was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm with a FlexStation3.0 (Molecular Device). IC<sub>50</sub> values of doxorubicin on the two cell lines were calculated by GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and fold reversal (FR) was calculated using the following Equation (6): <disp-formula>
        <label>(6)</label>FR = IC<sub>50</sub> of DOX without ALI/IC<sub>50</sub> of DOX in combination with ALI</disp-formula></p>
        <p>In order to better assess the nature of the interaction between alisol F 24 acetate and doxorubicin, the CompuSyn 1.0 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39-molecules-21-00183">39</xref>] was used to plot the effect. The concentrations used for doxorubicin was 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 &#x3BC;M and that of ALI were 2, 5, 10 &#x3BC;M. A Combination Index (CI) less than, equal to and larger than 1 indicates synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, respectively. Based on these algorithms, computer software has been developed to allow automated simulation of synergism and antagonism at all dose or effect levels. Fa, the abbreviation of fraction affected, serves as the percent cell inhibition and CI represents combination index.If the percentage of cell inhibition (Fa) <italic>vs.</italic> Log (CI) &lt; 0, it indicates that ALI has a good synergic activity with doxorubicin.</p>

        <p>The MCF-7/DOX cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. Five treatment groups were designed: negative control with medium only, positive control with 10 &#x3BC;M verapamil, test groups with 3 different concentrations of ALI (5 &#x3BC;M, 10 &#x3BC;M, and 20 &#x3BC;M). After 2 h incubation at 37 &#xB0;C, 10 &#x3BC;M doxorubicin was added and the incubation continued for another 2 h. The drugs were removed rapidly and cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 10 min in dark. After a PBS wash, cells were treated with 1 &#x3BC;g/mL Hoechst33342 (nucleus dye) for 20 min in dark. The dye was removed quickly and wells were washed three times with PBS. The fluorescence intensity of the intracellular doxorubicin and the nuclear doxorubicin were detected by High Content Analysis instrument (Operetta, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and their ratios were calculated. Fluorescence excitation wavelength and emission wavelength of Hoechst33342 (blue light) and doxorubicin (red light) were Ex = 380 nm/Em = 445 nm and the Ex = 535 nm/Em = 595 nm respectively.</p>
